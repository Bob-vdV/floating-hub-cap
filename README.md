# Floating-hub-cap

Openscad files for a floating wheel hub cap. More details are at https://www.printables.com/model/928406. 

The latest STL files are downloadable at https://github.com/Bob-vdV/floating-hub-cap/releases/latest.

## Manual generation

Each STL file can be generated normally using the openscad GUI. The nightly version of openscad is highly recommended because of its better performance with manifold. All parameters can be changed using the customizer in `centercap_main.scad`. The most important four parameters are at the top under `main parameters`. For each part in the `selected part` dropdown menu, render and export it to an STL.

## Customizing and generating STL files automatically

To generate the STL files automatically you also need python installed. 

The parameters of the hub cap can be set in `centercap_main.json`. Any parameter listed in `centercap_main.scad` can be added and changed via the json file. 

All STL files can then be generated by executing the following command:

`python ./make.py` 

This python script creates the build folder and then generates all STL files for all parameter sets in the json file.
